ETH Token Program
A program made with solidity (0.8.19) that has a Token Minting and Burning functionality

Description
The program demonstrates the basics of solidity using concepts like smart contracts, variables and their types, mapping, and functions. The program particularly has two functions -

Mint Token
Burn Token
The Burn function also considers the total supply before burning Tokens using the Conditional Statement concept, as the burn amount should not be more than the total supply.
